Walking down the street  
Kicking cans  
Looking at the billboard  
Also ran  
Summing up the people  
Checking out the race  
Doing what I’m doing  
Feeling out of place

Walking, walking in the rain

Feeling like a woman  
Looking like a man  
Sounding like a no-no  
Make it when I can  
Whistling in the darkness  
Shining in the light  
Coming to conclusion  
Right is might is tight

Walking, walking in the rain

Come in all you jesters  
Enter all you fools  
Sit down no-no  
Ogre, ghouls  
Trip the light fantastic  
Dance the swivel hips  
Coming to conclusion  
Button up your lips

Walking, walking in the rain  
Walking, walking in the rain
