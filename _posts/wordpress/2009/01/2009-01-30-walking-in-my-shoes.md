I would tell you about the things  
They put me through  
The pain Ive been subjected to  
But the lord himself would blush  
The countless feasts laid at my feet  
Forbidden fruits for me to eat  
But I think your pulse would start to rush

Now Im not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes

Youll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes

Morality would frown upon  
Decency look down upon  
The scapegoat fates made of me  
But I promise you, my judge and jurors  
My intentions couldnt have been purer  
My case is easy to see

Im not looking for a clearer conscience  
Peace of mind after what Ive been through  
And before we talk of repentance  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes

Youll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes

Now Im not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes

Youll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes

Now Im not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes

Youll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes
